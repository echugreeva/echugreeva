I am a JavaScript Full Stack Developer 👩🏻‍💻 with a background in web creation, educational tech, and the cybersecurity industry. Passionate about user experience and creating impactful solutions. A former digital marketer, I possess a strong understanding of business processes, user flows, and data analysis. At a certain point, I made the decision to transition from learning human languages to mastering machine languages. So here I am looking 👀 to work on a new project.


⚒️ ⌨️ My Technical Skills:
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Redux, Bootstrap, Material UI, Ant Design, 
- Back-end: NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL
- Other relevant skills: REST APIs, Git, Google ads scripts, Google ads API, Data studio/ Looker, ChatGPT API


Aside from coding and learning, I like my wine 🍷, sea 🌊 and a good show to binge. And sport. Obviously. 😉
